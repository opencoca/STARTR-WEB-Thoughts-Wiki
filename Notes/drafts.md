## CHAPTER 1

### Introduction

The diagrammed process was for training students to generate a set of goal-oriented assessment items, which were then rated by students.

## CHAPTER 2

### Introduction

In this dissertation, I discuss how to use patterns to develop goal-oriented assessments. A pattern is a general class of items.

## CHAPTER 3

### Goal-Oriented Item Forming

By creating a template for developing items, we can have a framework for generating items.

## PREFACE

When I started in edutaction 15 years ago, I had no idea I would become so passionate about the field. I started teaching because I knew I wanted to teach, but wasn't counting on focusing on building tools for students of all ages.

I stumbled into teaching, thanks to a very un-productive application process. (Just enough to say I was a good candidate, and not enough for the McGill to choose me.) In the end I took a job teaching at a small private school with some amazing professors.

I realized quickly was the student population that year was very diverse, with students coming in with differing definitions of "college readiness." So instead of developing great lessons for a test that would just lead to application rejections, I started designing lessons to achieve an improved level of world readiness.

## Subtitle

### Three ways to integrate STEAM into a classroom

## Preface

I completed my first Ed-Tech course at Concordia in the mid 2000s. Along with the usual education topics I also focused on learning how to write C, data structures, algorithms, and all the typical things Computer Science students should know. What really stood out for me about the Explorations course was the emphasis on Human-Computer Interaction. Every week we would have the other three computer courses visit our class and present to us on their project. Many students would send us a link to a website they were working on, or a prototype that they had made, and we would guide them through the necessary world of web technologies. Students would come in and out of my office all day long, dragging me away as they worked on an idea: prototyping, designing, and finally writing code.

Fast-forward and I am the cofounder of Robot in a Can, this time in the MIT Extension School. I am in a small group with five other developers, all of us hoping to work our way into education either through online courses (such as MOOCs), or through teaching high school students. We have settled on a vision for Education, and we aim to implement it

Guidelines for a room of 100 students.

Alex and Ben have experience teaching k-12 and college-level students, and would like to share their insights and advice with you.

Our set of guidelines for the class room is designed to help teachers set the appropriate pace for a class of students in a way that makes long-term, sustained student progress feasible. The goals listed below are meant to serve as a'set of state markers'.  These goals should be steadily approached and attempted by each of the students in the class.  When completed, the set of state markers allows the instructor to shift to a new set of state markers.  

## Intro: World Readiness

Throughout the academic year, we conduct a variety of workshops, research projects, and educational outreach to help prepare the world for the role CS might play in the coming years. We also regularly conduct outreach and education programs that we hope will encourage innovation in our fields as well as inspire others to improve their own situations. 

One such project is `World Readiness`.

* The aim of `World Readiness` is to understand the different ways in which social systems seek to adapt to new conditions. What role might CS play in such adaptation?
* `World Readiness` is a research project that contrasts and compares educational and non-educational approaches to learn about how different organizations try to support new learning conditions.
* Using a principal/agent approach, we can model the role of an expanded community or a central system that supports learning.
* Not only does this help us better understand how different people or organizations might meet the challenges of rapidly changing social conditions, but it also helps us understand how these organizations or communities might fail in their efforts to change.

While there may be a number of reasons why the adoption of the CS discipline has been relatively slow, it is ouropinion that the field is facing a number of challenges:

  * CS is not introduced at a young age
  * CS is too bound to the computer
  * CS is not available at most institutions
 
Not introducing CS means loosing out on a toolbox for critical thinking.

## CHAPTER 1 - Illuminating the Paths to Knowledge

Envision learning a new technology and immediately
you are flooded with thoughts of how this approach would help - or
at least contribute - to the solving of the world's problems. To
some, education is about training a person to be a great cog in the
wheel of progress; devices like these engines of knowledge are
essential to that vision.

But different approaches to learning are better suited for
different types of problems. As the technology of information and
communication grows, the opportunity for learners to seek answers
has never been greater. Trends indicate that this rising tide of
information, coupled with widespread access to information over the
Internet, presents learners with new challenges and opportunities.
So greater technology has not necessarily resulted in greater
learning.

One response to this growing freedom of information is to
invest time and effort in training educators to share the
knowledge. While technology is a powerful way to communicate and
the tools
